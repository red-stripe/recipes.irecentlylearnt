    1. Aerate the flour by sifting both white and wholegrain into the large mixing bowl. Recombine and wholegrain husks that dont make it through the sieve into the bowl.
    2. Finely chop up all the nuts. (pumpkin & walnut are my defaults)
    3. Add the nuts, salt, sugar, yeast and stir to combine.
    4. Make a well in the middle of the mixture then add about 3/4 of the water.
    5. Stir to combine ingredients, adding more water to form a dough. (Avoid over mixing at this stage or the dough will become stiff. You can add a splash more water if required.)
    6. Lightly flour a clean bench & turn the dough out. Knead for a few minutes till it's soft and springs back when pressed.
    7. Lightly flour the mixing bowl, then return the dough to rise for about 45 minutes. Cover with a clean cloth and wait for the dough to double in size.
    8. Wait for dough to rise. Make a coffee and chill out.
    9. Once the dough has doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 180C. Dust a baking tray with flour and gently turn out the dough onto the tray.
    10. Gently shape the dough with your palms, then score a line along the top a centimeter or so deep. Dust lightly with flour.
    11. Once the oven has reached temperture, bake the loaf for around 50 minutes. Checking it during the final 20 & covering with tinfoil if the top begins to brown up too much.
    12. Once the loaf is crusty and sounds hollow when tapped, remove from the oven and allow to cool.
