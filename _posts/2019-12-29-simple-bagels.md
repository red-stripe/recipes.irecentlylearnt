  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 480g white flour (4 cups)

    * olive oil

    1. In a mixing bowl combine warm water & yeast, wait 5 minutes for yeast to activate.
    2. Add the flour, sugar and salt to the activated yeast. Mix until a dough forms that is slightly stiff and dry. (About 10 minutes by hand)
    3. Turn out the dough onto a floured surface, then knead for 5 minutes.
    4. Lightly grease a bowl with olive oil, add dough & cover. Place somewhere warm to rise till it has doubled in size. About 60-90 minutes.
    5. Turn out the dough onto a clean work surface and gently press to remove some of the air. Divide into 8 roughly even balls.
    6. Pre-heat your oven to 220c
    7. In a large source pan heat water to a boil then reduce temperature to a light simmer. Add a little extra oil and brown sugar to the bath to help glaze the bagels.
    8. Form your dough balls into bagels and add them to the water bath 2 or 3 at a time. The bagels should have enough room to float around without sticking to each other, or the bottom / sides of the pan. Cook them for about 1 minute, flipping to cook the topside after 30 seconds.
    9. Place the blanched bagels on a rack to steam off while you prepare the next batch.
    10. Prep a baking tray by laying out parchment paper or lightly oiling, then layout your bagels.
    11. Bake for 20-25 minutes, allow to cool for 10 minutes before eating.
